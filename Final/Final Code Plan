Final Code Plan

My project is an interactive guessing game. When the user clicks the "Hide Rick" button, Rick comes out of the 
drawer and moves around the screen until he hides behind a cup. Also when this button is pressed, rick will yell "I'm pickle 
Rick" and Morty will rise up from under the table with a confused look on his face. Once he stops moving and hides then 
the user hits the "Begin the Game" button and the cups begin to make back and forth across the table. At this time, rick will 
then sync up  with one of the cups movements, so that he cannot be seen by the mover. Also, when this button is pressed another 
quote from the show will play. When the cups stop moving then the user will have the option to pick which cup Rick is behind.
I believe I will turn the cups into buttons so that when they are clicked they will play a message or complete in action in 
order to accomplish the choosing part of the game. If they win then they are greeted with an audio file, which will be a
quote from the show, and a celebration message. Also there will be a button so that the user can switch the difficulty of 
the game. When the slider is moved to the highest difficulty, I will increase the framerate of the game so that the cups 
move faster in order to make it harder to follow. Also when they increase the difficulty I want to introduce a very fast 
paced song. I would like to include a reset button if I can figure that out.So overall the user interaction focuses around
pressing buttons and following the cups so that they can guess which cup Rick is hiding behind.
