Code Plan

My project is an interactive guessing game. When the user clicks the "Hide Rick" button, Rick comes out of the 
drawer and moves around the screen until he hides behind a cup. Once he stops moving and hides then the user hits
the "Go" button and the cups begin to make back and forth across the table. At this time, rick will then sync up 
with one of the cups movements, so that he cannot be seen by the mover. When the cups stop moving then the user will
have the option to pick which cup Rick is behind. If they win then they are greeted with an audio file and a celebration
message. Also when the Hide Rick button is pressed, then a song about Pickle Rick will play so the user can listen to
music as they play the game. Also there will be a button so that the user can switch the difficulty of the game. When they
press the dificulty buttons, it will change the speed of how fast the cups move. So overall the user interaction focuses 
around pressing buttons and following the cups so that they can guess which cup Rick is hiding behind.
