Final Version of my Rick and Morty themed cup game. 
This game features six buttons and a slider.
The guessing system is made up of 3 buttons, one for each cup.
When the user guesses the wrong cup, a dissapointed audio file plays.
When the user guesses right, pickle rick jumps out from behind the cup and yells "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub."
I made the font in photoshop using three text layers with different strokes  for each word. This allowed me to try and match the show's logo as close as I could.
  
  
  Issues;
Now the two major issues I ran into when developing this program surrounds the speed of the game, and the reset button.
The reset button works, however the page has to be refreshed in order for the hide rick and begin the game buttons to work. So when the reset button is pushed, the cups and rick are sent to their original places, but the program does not allow you to try the game again.
I spent a lot of time trying to get the slider to work in order for the speed of the game to change. I was able to create the slider and assign the value the user selected from it to a variable. However, after this I was unable to multiply this value by a counter. I tried creating a new var that was multiplied by the speed value, but I could not get it to work. 


Besides theses two issues, I am pretty happy about how everything else turned out.
