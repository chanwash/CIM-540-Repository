3 ideas for Midterm

1. Create an interacive world for a new interactive creature. This would include a changing environment, with different sounds. 

This idea consists of branching off one our original assignments to create a simple character. In addition to this character, I would change the environment at the request of the user using a button. As the environments changed, I would also change the background sounds associated with each environment. The user would also be given options so that they can interact with the creature.


2. Make a moving cup guessing game.

This idea focuses on the standard cup moving game. This is where an object is hidden under a certain cup and the viewer must keep track of this cup in order to memorize where the object ends up. The cups would move around the screen for around 15 seconds. Then they would stop and the viewer would be asked which cup they thought the object was hidden under. If they guessed correctly, they would be congratulated with a message and confetti. After this the game would be over and the user would have an option to reset the game.


3. Create a game with an interactive character where you most avoid other characters.

This idea focuses on an character which the user controls with the mouse. The user must navigate the character around other creatures that are randomly moving around the screen. This is similar to the computer game slither.io, except instead of "eating" the characters, you must avoid them completely. This would be challenging, as the other creatures are randomly moving around and if you touch any part of them, then it is game over.
